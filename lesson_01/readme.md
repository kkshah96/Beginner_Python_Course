# Lesson 01

In this lesson, we will take an over-simplified approach to learning about what programming is

## Key terms

* **Programming language**: An intermediary between human language and computer language, that makes it possible for us to "communicate" with the computer, using typed out words and phrases. Python is one of many different programming languages.
* **Software**: Instructions that tell a computer what to do (often times via a programming language)
* **Syntax**: The grammar rules that must be followed by a programming language
* **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment - essentially a fancy text editor that allows us to effectively write computer programs, and also run the computer programs

## Lesson

### What is programming?

Just as we communicate with other human beings using languages such as English, computer programming is the process in which we communicate with the computer using a language that it can interpret. However, computers cannot directly process the code we write in Python or any other high-level programming language, and can actually only "understand" binary (0's and 1's). Programming languages are, simply put, an intermediary between computer language and human language that makes it possible for humans to communicate with the computer. Programming languages like Python or Java use a combination of special English keywords, symbols, and grammar rules (called "syntax" in computer terminology) to allow us to more easily provide instructions to the computer. Thankfully, when we run our own computer programs (assuming we have properly installed the programming language and all it's requirements on our machine), they will automatically be converted into 0's and 1's behind the scenes. In this course, we will be using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is just a fancy text editor that allows us to both write computer programs, and also run them on our computers.

Example:

* We can write the following code in our IDE of choice:

```
print('hello world')
```

* This is a simple computer instruction that follows the syntax rules of Python version 3
* When we run the code (often times using a keyboard shortcut or by pressing a "play" button in the IDE), we will see the text `hello world` appear in a small window
* Our code, behind the scenes, was converted to computer language (e.g. 0's and 1's), given to the computer to execute, and as a result, the computer was able to "print" the phrase `hello world` on the screen in our IDE

Note: We will in a later lesson discuss more about how to debug errors in our code that can cause the computer to fail to understand the instructions we write, or interpret them in a way we don't expect it to.
